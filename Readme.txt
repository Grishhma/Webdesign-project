AlbinoNetwork - A forum for Albino's

The purpose of this website is to closely knit a community of people widespread across
the globe who suffer from a skin condition caused by a genetic disorder called Albinism. 
Albinism is one of the prevalent inherited disorders that affects millions of people by birth,
and leads to a more difficult life as compared to other fellow human beings. This website
will be a forum for various Albino's to share their life experiences and make a congenial
space to discuss their happiness and struggles.

We also will be providing some basic information on the forum to spread awareness on
Albinism for people who are our allies as well as people who lack knowledge about the
same.
